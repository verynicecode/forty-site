%h2 Information Collected

%p
  The data that is collected and stored by Forty are all the things you would
  expect that are necessary to run the service.

%ul
  %li
    %strong Time tracking data:
    Forty is personal time tracking software so its primary purose is to keep
    the data entered for hours worked, pto taken and any adjustments.

  %li
    %strong Email address:
    Forty asks for your email address and password when you sign up and
    providing an email address will result in the best experience. Things like
    password resets and email receipts depend on a valid email address.

  %li
    %strong Password:
    Your password is stored as a #{link_to "bcrypt", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt"}
    hash. It's an industry standard for storing passwords. It means that even
    in the event that someone did obtain the bcrypt value, it would be very
    hard to derive your actual password from it.

  %li
    %strong Billing information:
    If you choose to subscribe, your billing information is sent directly to
    #{link_to "Stripe", "https://stripe.com/"}, a leading online payments
    platform. Billing information is not stored by Forty for your security. You
    can read more about their #{link_to "privacy policy", "https://stripe.com/privacy"}
    and #{link_to "security practices", "https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe"}.
